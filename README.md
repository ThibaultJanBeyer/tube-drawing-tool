My first <a class="preventloader" href="http://www.processing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Processing</a> application. Processing is fun because you get quick results! Try out my Tube Drawing Tool. First you choose the canvas size with the "+" and "-" buttons then you click into the canvas and can start/stop drawing tubes with the "d" key for draw. If you’ve got a decent result, save it with the "s" key for save. You’ll get a portable network graphic to use and reuse and re-re-re-use. Even sell and resell, you’ve all rights! <a class="preventloader" href="https://thibaultjanbeyer.github.io/tube-drawing-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Have fun drawing</a>!
